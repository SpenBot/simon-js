# simon-js
simon game in javascript


# ISSUES

- no click (or touch for mobile) controls
- user can play notes while simon is playing
- balance is a little off, it gets real hard real fast
- beeps won't play sometimes (it doesn't load fast enough, or the last one doesn't finish playing)


# POSSIBLE FEATURES

- losing screen
- webaudio generated boops, instead of playing mp3s
- show a list of notes you've played so far, x out the one you played wrong
- random increments of time between notes
- as player progresses, increase the number of pads
- score system
- beat that plays in the background?
